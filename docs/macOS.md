## Pichon for macOS

This is an article on how to use our **desktop app Pichon on macOS**. You might be a completely new user or an experienced one – it's still a good idea to check this tutorial out, since Pichon has a lot to offer.

## Installation

You can download and install Pichon for macOS from our [website](https://icons8.com/app/macos) or [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pichon-by-icons8/id786188363?mt=12).

Once the app is installed, click the profile button and log in to your Icons8 account. It will sync your subscription properties and Collections with Pichon. You’ll see your Favorites and will be able to access all the paid features available under your subscription plan.

Check out the **Preferences** menu too – it allows you to switch between themes to make it easy on your eyes. Then set the start options and choose between simplified or non-simplified SVGs, if that's needed:

## Icons

Pichon has **Categories**, **Styles**, and **Collections**. Icons in **Categories** are sorted by theme and in **Style** by the style they're drawn in. **Collections** tab has all your favorites and downloaded icons, plus you can create your own collections there too.

### Search

To find an icon, type in some definitive word into the search bar.  You can choose specific styles or check out icons in all styles at once. To save an icon, just right-click on it. Right-clicking on the icon also allows you to find icons in the same style:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/2.1.Save.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### Collections

You can also add new collections, export and share them by right-clicking – press the 'Create collection' button or right-click a particular collection:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/2.3.Collections.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### Other features

**Adding assets to editors**

To download an icon, sign in, choose its size and format in the tab on the right and either save it with a right-click or drag-drop it to wherever you want, for example, Lunacy:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/2.4.Uploading.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

**Recoloring icons**

Recoloring is done by clicking on the colour button at the right upper corner next to the icon style:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/2.6.Recoloring.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## Illustrations

Pichon also has illustrations – you can access this library by switching between types of assets in this tab:

<p align="center">
  <img width="auto" height="auto" src="/public/1.3.Assets.png">
</p>

### Search

While searching for illustrations, you can sort them by categories and style:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/3.1.Search.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### Size and format

Click on an illustration to choose its size and format:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/3.2.Formatting.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## Photos

Illustrations from our library can be accessed by switching the asset type in this tab:

<p align="center">
  <img width="auto" height="auto" src="/public/1.3.Assets.png">
</p>

### Search

Photos can be sorted either by categories or by tags. You can also eliminate all photos with background from your search with the 'No background' toggle:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/4.1.Search.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### Size

Click on a photo to choose its size:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/4.2.Formatting.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## My Images

You can start exploring My Images tab by uploading or drag and dropping images from your device:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/5.1.Uploading.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

After that, you can share the uploaded image, find similar images in Pichon's photo gallery, remove the image's background, upscale it and export the edited version – all from the tab on the right:

<p align="center">
  <img width="auto" height="auto" src="/public/1.4.MyImages.png">
</p>

Each image is automatically tagged by our AI detectors, but you can also add your own tags.

You can organize images by adding them to different folders. Folders can be exported or shared with your Icons8 friends, same as Collections:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/5.2.Folders.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
