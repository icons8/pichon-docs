# Pichon for Windows

This is an article on how to use our **Pichon** desktop app on Windows. You might be a completely new user or an experienced one – it's still a good idea to check this tutorial out, since Pichon has a lot to offer.

## Installation and Settings

You can download and install Pichon from our [website](https://icons8.com/app/windows) or [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/9NK8T1KSHFFR).

Once the app is installed, launch Pichon, click on the cog button in the top-right corner and choose Account to log in to your Icons8 profile. This will sync your user data with Pichon, letting you access all the paid features available under your subscription plan.

In the **General** tab of the settings you can find Pichon's preferences:

* **Dark mode** — lets you switch between light and dark themes to make it easier on the eyes.
* **Fix Mode** on Recolor —
* **Launch with Windows** — Pichon will launch upon logging in to the system.
* **Show application in the taskbar** — Pichon will be shown in Windows taskbar.
* **Always on top** — Makes pichon stay at the top of any opened apps.
* **Synchronize icons** — 
* **Use simplified SVG** — Downloaded SVG icons will have a single path. Leave this enabled if you don't plan to edit the icon.

Use **Updates** tab to update Pichon, go to Icons8.com or check out our FAQ.

## Browsing

Icons in Pichon are divided into **Collections**, **Styles**, and **Categories**. Clicking on a particular tab will open and close it. **Collections** include your favorites and downloaded icons and allows you to create and manage your custom collections. **Styles** tab lists all the visual styles our icons come in. **Categories** sort icons by themes and topics.

### Search

To find an icon, type in some definitive word into the search bar.  You can choose specific styles or check out icons in all styles at once. To save an icon, just right-click on it.

Right-clicking on the icon also allows you to find icons in the same style:

You can upload your own icons to Pichon by dragging them onto an active collection area from the Explorer.

**Changing the size of the icon and format**
