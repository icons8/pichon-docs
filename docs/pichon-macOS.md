# Pichon for macOS

Here is a tutorial on how to use our desktop app with icons on macOS. You might be a completely new user or on the contrary an experienced one – it's still a good idea to check this tutorial out since Pichon has a lot to offer.

## Installation

You can download and install Pichon for macOS from our website or App Store.

Once the app is installed, click the profile button and log in to your Icons8 account. It will sync your subscription properties and Collections with Pichon. You’ll see your Favorites and will be able to access all the paid features available under your subscription plan.

Check out the 'Preferences' menu too – it allows you to switch between themes to make it easy on your eyes. Then set the start options and choose between simplified or non-simplified SVGs, if that's needed:

## Icons

Pichon has Categories, Styles and Collections. Icons in Categories are sorted by theme, in Style by the style they're drawn in and Collections has all your favourites and downloads, plus you can create your own collections too.

### Search

To find an icon, type in some definitive word into the search bar.  You can choose specific styles or check out icons in all styles at once. To save an icon just right-click on it.

### Collections

Right-clicking on the icon also allows you to find icons in the same style:

You can add new collections, export and share them – press the 'Create collection' button or right-click a particular collection:

You can change the size of the icon and its format in the tab on the right which appears after you click on an icon:
